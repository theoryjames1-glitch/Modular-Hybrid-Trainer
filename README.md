Got it ‚Äî here‚Äôs a **clear theory summary** of how your **HybridTrainer** works, plus a roadmap of improvements and additions you can plan next.

# üìñ Theory of HybridTrainer

### **Core Idea**

Your **HybridTrainer** combines:

1. **Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)**

   * Classic next-token prediction with labeled data (prompt ‚Üí target).
   * Ensures the model learns structured behavior and aligns with training data.

2. **Reinforcement Learning via PPO**

   * Model generates responses to prompts.
   * Responses are scored by a **reward function** (sentiment, similarity, truthfulness, toxicity, etc.).
   * PPO adjusts the model to maximize reward while staying close to a **reference model** (to prevent collapse).

This dual cycle lets the model:

* **Learn from examples** (SFT).
* **Refine outputs** based on task-specific preferences (PPO).

# ‚öôÔ∏è Training Loop

1. **Prepare dataset**

   * Shuffle, filter, tokenize.
   * Mask prompt labels so loss applies only to the response.

2. **SFT Step**

   * Batch goes through **SFTTrainer**.
   * Optimizer + scheduler update LM head parameters.

3. **PPO Step**

   * Model generates candidate responses from the same batch.
   * Reward function(s) evaluate the responses.
   * PPO loss updates both **LM head + Value head**, guided by reward.
   * Reference model keeps PPO stable.

4. **Alternate** between SFT and PPO steps in cycles.

# üõ† Current Strengths

* Works with **any Hugging Face causal LM** (e.g., GPT-2).
* **Modular optimizers & schedulers** (via factories).
* **Flexible reward design** (sentiment, perplexity, truthfulness, BLEU/ROUGE, similarity).
* Supports **tiny smoke tests** before scaling.

# üöÄ Roadmap: Next Things to Do

### **Stage 1: Stability & Usability**

* [ ] **Fix PPO batching** ‚Üí ensure correct queries/responses alignment.
* [ ] Add **logging & metrics** (wandb/JSON logs for SFT loss & PPO reward).
* [ ] **Checkpoint merging** ‚Üí periodically save SFT+PPO merged weights.

### **Stage 2: Reward Expansion**

* [ ] Finalize **modular reward factory** (CosineSTS, BLEU, ROUGE, Toxicity, etc.).
* [ ] Add **composite rewards** (weighted sum + postprocessors like Clip, EMA).
* [ ] Support **human preference data** ‚Üí train reward models.
* [ ] Integrate **task-specific rewards** (domain relevance, coverage, style).

### **Stage 3: Scalability**

* [ ] Add **gradient accumulation + fp16** for bigger batches.
* [ ] Multi-GPU / DeepSpeed integration.
* [ ] Curriculum training (start SFT-heavy, gradually increase PPO ratio).

### **Stage 4: Advanced Alignment**

* [ ] **Multiple reference models** (different domains or baselines).
* [ ] **Self-play reward shaping** (model compares its own outputs).
* [ ] **LLM-as-a-judge reward** (GPTScore, COMET, BLEURT).
* [ ] Plug in **safety rewards** (toxicity, truthfulness, factuality).

### **Stage 5: Long-Term Extensions**

* [ ] Add **Mixture-of-Rewards** (auto-weighted rewards via learned controller).
* [ ] Explore **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)** as alternative to PPO.
* [ ] Hybrid training for **multi-turn dialogue** (not just single prompt ‚Üí response).
* [ ] Publish benchmarks (WikiText, IMDB, custom datasets).

‚úÖ In short:

* **Now:** It works ‚Äî alternating SFT + PPO with modular rewards.
* **Next:** Expand reward flexibility, add logging, stabilize PPO.
* **Later:** Scale to multi-GPU, richer alignment (truth, safety, preference learning).
